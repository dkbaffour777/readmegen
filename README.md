## Description 

  Writing a new README file for a project can be challenging at first to remember and cover all aspects of the project just by starting out on a blank page. So with this issue at hand, Readmegen provides a series of questions, which altogether serves as a template for a professional README file. After the user answers each question accordingly, the information is formatted into a README.md file including all or at the bare minimum, contents that manifest professionalism.
